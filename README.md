# edunets (work in progress)

Edunets is a very simple automatic differentiation engine built to be easily understood and give a better insight on how neutal networks work under the hood. It focuses solely on the algorithmic aspect of the automatic differentiation, so it has no GPU support and no massive optimizations.

The notebook ```demos.ipynb``` demonstrates some of the things edunets can do.

## Installation
